This is Fox - Version 2.

This bot was originally made by Mitchell Cooper (IRC Nickname: Cooper). 
This bot has been on Github for a while, so i got board and started finding ways to add features to it.
Now this forked to be version 2 because Mitchell has gave up on PHP and has moved on to Perl.

The support chat for Fox2 is at: irc.technoirc.net #rkhtech
